One of the hallmarks of the Religious Studies program at the University of Alabama is the integration of digital scholarship in the curriculum of the BA and MA programs, as well as in faculty research. Projects range from podcasting, video-editing, and web design to the application of machine learning to the study of religion in culture. 

This page offers a sample of the past and current digital scholarship taking place within the <a href="https://religion.ua.edu/">Department of Religious Studies</a> at the <a href="https://www.ua.edu/">University of Alabama</a>.
