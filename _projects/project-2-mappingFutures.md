The aim is not merely to test orthodox accounts of topical emphases in philosophy of religion, but to test those results with comparison corpora from philosophy and religious studies journals in order to propose future topics for philosophers of religion."

Philosophy of religion is a sub-field of both religious studies and philosophy whose 
conventional focus on topics and problems specific to Western Christianity costs it the ability to  research other sources and locations of religious reason-giving. How may researchers build bridges from those conventional approaches towards other topics and problems? Were it useful  to find complimentary research, how would this be done across thousands of other, specialized  publications? This project repurposes data mining methods developed in the computer sciences  and digital humanities to work among large datasets comprised by leading journals of the past 100 years in religious studies, philosophy of religion and philosophy. The project uses computational methods to side step some of the human limits in resources prevent timely progress.

The project uses artificial intelligence applications to analyze the entirety of several representative journals in the fields of religious studies, the philosophy of religion and philosophy. The aim is not merely to test orthodox accounts of topical emphases in philosophy of religion, but to test those results with comparison corpora from philosophy and religious studies journals in order to propose future topics for philosophers of religion. The important and useful aspect of the project is that the particular data mining methods employed may be demonstrated to have the ability to propose a new topic by pointing to specific documents in past philosophy of religion scholarship as well as specific documents in adjacent fields.
