[Start with overview of vision of DH generally]

The new RELdl 

In collaboration with the existing digital humanities centers and resources on campus, including the Alabama Digital Humanities Center and the ?, the RELdl 


These central spaces include the new lab space in the Religious Studies library, the [RELdl website](http://digitallab.religion.ua.edu/), the [REL Digital Lab organization on Github](https://github.com/RELDigitalLab), and the REL Department on Slack.

In these spaces, faculty and students share ideas and resources for multiple aspects of digital scholarship including: digital pedagogy, computational research, public humanities, and digital publishing.



The goal of the RELdl is to facilitate faculty and student engagement with digital tools and methods in their research and teaching through the aggregation of expertise and resources (such as hosting teaching modules and data for computational analysis), as well as by hosting regular workshops and brown bags for particular tools and projects (open to REL faculty and students). The RELdl also provides space for aggregating news and information about the various ongoing or completed digital projects of the department. Ultimately, it is a space that encourages collaboration, possibly leading to shared projects along with co-authored submissions and publications.

Additionally, the RELdl is focused on facilitating relationships with groups outside REL, e.g., eTech, the UA Libraries, and the ADHC, concerning such items as web-hosting resources, issues of archiving and preservation, and additional technical capacity.

As part of an effort to bring better visibility to DH work throughout A&S and around campus, the RELdl also aims to facilitate an interdisciplinary DH working group with interested partners from across campus.

The first two off-shoot projects of the RELdl will be the creation of a “data hub” for publishing data suited to the study of identity and culture and the creation of an initial list of A&S faculty already working in this broad area.

Because of the variety of work done under the label of “digital humanities” and the range of expertise already in the REL department, the RELdl serves as a connecting node within the network of digital scholarship already taking place within the department. Rather than centralizing digital scholarship, the lab exists to connect projects to one another and to the resources around campus, as well as to provide access to shared infrastructure. Each scholar within the department tends to their own node(s) (digital projects, courses, etc.) of the network, while also contributing back to the shared resources of the RELdl.
