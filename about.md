title: About REL Digital Lab
permalink: /about/
---

The mission of the RELdl is to facilitate faculty and student engagement with digital tools and methods in their research and teaching through the aggregation of expertise and resources (such as hosting teaching modules and data for computational analysis), as well as by hosting regular workshops and brown bags for particular tools and projects. The RELdl also provides space for aggregating news and information about the various ongoing or completed digital projects of the department. Ultimately, it is a space that encourages collaboration, possibly leading to shared projects along with co-authored submissions and publications.

Additionally, the RELdl is focused on facilitating relationships with groups outside REL, e.g., eTech, the UA Libraries, and the ADHC, concerning such items as web-hosting resources, issues of archiving and preservation, and additional technical capacity.

Because of the variety of work done under the label of “digital humanities” and the range of expertise already in the REL department, the RELdl serves as a connecting node within the network of digital scholarship already taking place within the department. Rather than centralizing digital scholarship, the lab exists to connect projects to one another and to the resources around campus, as well as to provide access to shared infrastructure. Each scholar within the department tends to their own node(s) (digital projects, courses, etc.) of the network, while also contributing back to the shared resources of the RELdl.

In our "Resources" section you can find information about the [compute resources in the lab](), [project planning resources](), and [teaching resources]() for introducing software for use in the classroom. 



# Who are We?

## Jeri E. Wieringa, Director

Dr. Wieringa joined the REL faculty in 2020 as a specialist in digital humanities and the social theory of religion. An alumna of the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media, she has been active in digital humanities scholarship since 2011, and has worked on multiple grant-funded software and publishing projects, including Omeka and Digital Humanities Now. 

A historian by training, her research examines new religious movements in the US through the lenses of gender and technology, with a particular interest in millennialism and processes of knowledge formation. In the digital humanities space, she is focused on questions of methodology and infrastructure for the critical use of computation in the study of human cultures. In 2019, she defended the second digital history dissertation project accepted by the Department of History and Art History at George Mason Unversity, which used computational text analysis to explore the relationship between gender norms and end-times beliefs in the development of Seventh-day Adventism. 

She has experience in website design and development, digital publishing, Python, natural language processing and machine learning with historical texts, and project management. 

## Joseph (Joe) DeFrank, GRA

Coming to REL's M.A. in the Fall of 2020, Joseph DeFrank from Canton, GA, graduates in the Spring of 2020 with a B.S. in History and a B.A. in Religious Studies from Young Harris College. An Irish-American scholar for an academic year at Queen’s University of Belfast, some of his main interests include the study of religion in the United States, new religious movements, and what the future of “religion” might be.
