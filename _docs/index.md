The REL Digital Lab is the central hub for the digital humanities work of the Religious Studies Department at the University of Alabama.

## What the REL*dl* does

Our goals is to facilitate faculty and student engagement with digital tools and methods in their research and teaching through the aggregation of expertise and resources. We also focus on collaborating with interested partners across campus to develop new projects and bring additional visibility to the digital humanities scholarship taking place at UA. 

See more on our [About](/about/) page. 

## Using the REL*dl* "Resources" page

The Resources page brings together information on the physical lab and materials for planning digital projects and learning technical skills (**coming soon**) .

View "Lab Technologies" for an inventory of the [hardware and software](/docs/hardware/) currently available in the REL digital lab. The lab computers are available to REL faculty and students to reserve for research activities (Bookings link available through Slack).

We will be releasing additional resources on starting digital projects and for learning or teaching new skills in the coming months.

## How to connect with us

We are always looking to learn more about computational work taking place on capmpus and to explore future collaborations. Please [email Dr. Wieringa](mailto:jewieringa@ua.edu) to start a conversation.
